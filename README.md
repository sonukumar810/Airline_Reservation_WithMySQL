## Features

- Display available flights and details
- Manage seat availability for each flight
- Book, search, and cancel reservations

- Robust input validation and error handling

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL** (Backend Database)
- MySQL C API for database connectivity

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** The program connects to a MySQL database containing flight and seat information.
2. **User Interface:** Users can view available flights, check details, and manage bookings via a console-based menu.
3. **Booking Process:** Users select a flight and available seat to book; the data is updated in real-time.
